        <p class="bioText">My name is Stephen Heinen.  I live in San Antonio, TX and I am currently attending a full-stack web development course through the University of Arizona.  Coming from the Oil and Gas industry, this is a major change in my life, but I am eager and excited to learn.  One of the biggest pull factors in the development field is that you will never know it all, there will always be something new or something you can do better.  After the course is over, I plan on following it up with three smaller classes specifically on Javascript, React and Angular.  Please enjoy my page, check out some of my work and feel free to contact me with the info below!</p>
